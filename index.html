      <h1 class="hero-title">Connecting America: The 21 Airline Companies and The Ones You Should Choose </h1>
      <h2 class="hero-author">By Nilay Menon</h2>
      <p class="intro-text">
        In the United States, air travel is very common as there were about 7 million
        flights that have been taken in the year 2022. People are constantly on the move
        and using the sky as means for travel and transportation. During 2022, travelers were able to choose from 
        over 21 different airline companies when it came to domestic air travel. Now,
        what causes travelers to choose certain airline companies over others? 

        We will look into certain data like cancellation rates for popular airline companies, average delay times for each airline and even routes of 
        popular airline companies to see what airline companies are consumers using.

        One of the number one things we like to know is wheter the airline company
        we are choosing can get us from point A to point B safetly and on time. Being
        punctional is a big plus that travelers expect from airlines. If travelers cant
        be sure of the reliabilty of an airline in terms of delays, what would make them chose such 
        airline company? So lets examine
        the airlines and their average delay trends in minutes for each month for the year 2022.<br><br>
        If you hover over each line, you are able to see which airline company the line represents and their 
        average delay time in minutes for the whole year

      There are a couple of things to take away from this line plot. As we can 
      see there appears to be a certain trends for almost every airline during certain
      months. Between the months of March and July, there is a increase in delay times.
      This could be due to things like spring and summer break for students which can cause
      increase in airline demands and staff. The other trend we can see is that between the months 
      July and September, we can see a decline in delays potentially due to summer vacations
      ending and students starting to go back to school. This decline in delays doesnt last long
      as winter time is coming up and holidays like Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year's bring
      more delays due to an increase in demands from the airline. Of course, we can see some potential 
      outliers in these trends. For example, JetBlue has an abnormally high average delay time. This 
      could have been due to higher number of failures within the airline within ground control or
      even aircraft failures before takeoff. Certain airlines companies like Piedmont and Horizon 
      are subsidaries to major airline companies like American Airline and Alaska Airlines. The number
      of flights these subsidary companies might serve could be less which can attribute to less delays

        Now, where certain airlines operate are important when making a decision
        on which airline you would choose. Certain airlines go to certain places 
        while others dont service to certain airports. Knowing this type of information
        is crucial when making a financial decision on which airline you want to 
        choose for your next traveling option. So lets examine the 20 busiest airports in terms of
        flight traffic
        in the United States for 2022 and popular airline companies used by many travelers that operate in
        these airports. <br> <br>For a better viewabilty, if you hover over the legend on certain airlines, you are able to better 
        see where these airlines operate soley, the airlines cancellation percentage on flights and even the number of routes they offer from each of these major aiports.

       As you can see, Delta, United
      and American Airlines seem to operate to to almost all major airports in the
      US. These three airline companies have been around for a long time and have been considered very
      trustworthy in terms of the places they go and their track record when it comes to cancellations. 
      Other major airline companies like Spirit, Southwest, and Allegiant operate more towards
      smaller sized airports which might not be shown in the map but still have plenty of route
      options. Another thing to keep in mind, there are about 3 major aiports (JFK, LGA, and EWR) very close to each other
      in the New York/Jersey Area. These three airports are often very busy with flights espcially coming from 
      Delta, American, United, and even other airlines like JetBlue and Spirit Airlines.

        There really is no right answer. It all depends on your needs such as price, comfort and where you 
        need to go in the United States. Of course, besides those things, I had examined 
        potential other things like cancellation rates, the number of routes coming from the top 20 
        busiest airports, and even average delay times for each month for popular airlines used daily by 
        resdients of the United States. If we look at these facts, I would choose either 
        American, United, or Delta Airlines. These three companies have been around for a long time, know
        what they are doing when it comes to flight reliabilty as they and have very minal delay times and
        cancellation rates during peak times, provide about 96 routes for American Airlines, 87 routes for United Airlines, 
        116 routes for Delta Airlines from major airports and even go across from west to east coast or the opposite. 
        In the end, travelers have preferences and might even prefer the status of an airline to another.
        Ultimately, the airline you choose is up to you
